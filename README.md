## Hello 🫡
My name is Blake (he/him/his)

I'm an HFT developer located in Chicago, IL 🌬️.  
I don't code much outside of work, because going outside is cool 😎.  
That is, unless you have a cool project in any of the following languages: 
 - Rust 🦀
 - C/C++ 🌊
 - Python/Julia 🐍
 - Haskell 😕
 - Zig (I'm curious) ⚡

I love people, animals, and nature (PS. they're all the same thing). Big urban planning nerd 🤓.  
 
Just tryna keep this space rock livable 🌎🌍🌏.  

Vegan for the animals 💚.
